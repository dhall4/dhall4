I love to learn and share my passion for creating and technology. In my previous career I was a retail sales agent for 7+years where I honed my communication and teamwork skills by assisting a wide variety of customers with an ever expanding list of problems and questions . I spend my free time exploring new tools to enhance my hobbies and I'm taking steps to create tools of my own. One of those hobbies is collaborative storytelling, where I organize weekly meetings, plan narratives, and keep track of key details.

Currently I've been recording data with the hope of answering "When is it the best time to play a game?" and learning the tools and skills needed to create a dashboard to easily display my conclusions. I would love to have you reach out and provide me with tips or suggestions for this project!

I'm seeking to work with a passionate team in an environment where we can cultivate our knowledge of technology, face challenging problems, and expand our skillsets.
